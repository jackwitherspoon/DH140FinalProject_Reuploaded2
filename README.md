# Project Overview

Introduction to Research Questions:

1. What does the typical prisoner at Eastern State Penitentiary look like?
2. What effect does education have on the length of a prisoner's sentence?
3. What relationship does the number of convictions have on the prisoner's length of sentence?

# Why it is important to me:

I chose to analyze the findings of "Prisoner records from the Eastern State Penitentiary" because I am interested in researching pressing social issues, and felt this topic was particularly important in the wake of recent developments.

# Description of Data Set:

Record of admission of prisoners number 20 through 1124, including name, crime, sentence, place of origin, race/ethnicity, time in and time out, and comments on moral and educational condition.

# Data Sources:

# Scope Analysis & Intended Visualization:

The first task I want to begin analyzing the data is to find descriptive statistics of the number of crime victims, and organize contingency tables of offender races, crime offenses and sentence length. This will ensure our main variables will be summarized and easily integrated into the project. With my initial data exploration completed I would like to run a T-test on the correlation between offender race and the length of sentence. This can be visualized through either a histogram or a series of box polots.

# Conclusion:

I expect the most common races of offenders were white, black or African American, and Mixed. Since it is publicized that our judical system can be very biased I expect there to be a strong relationship between race and length of sentence. With longer sentences being given out to people of color. In addition, I also expect that the most common forms of crimes to be Murder, Theft and Drug use. I don't expect to see many vanilism or damage of property charges because these crimes can often be hard to catch the offender.
